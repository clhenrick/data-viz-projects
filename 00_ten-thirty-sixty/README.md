#Visualizing the numbers 10, 30 & 60
This was the result of an in-class thirty minute long exercise to visualize the numbers 10, 30 and 60 with a various materials. Colors were chosen due to their hue value on the HSB scale, while the amount of material was attempted to be measured proportionally to each number's fraction of the three numbers' total (eg: 10 is 1/10 of 100, 30 is 3/10 of 100 and 60 is 6/10 of 100).
